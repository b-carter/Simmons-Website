    <h1>Welcome, Prospectives (and freshmen)!</h1>
    <p id="intro-prospectives" class="larger">Simmons Hall is an MIT dormitory that houses 340
    awesome undergraduates, 5,538 windows, and an unknown population
    of velociraptors. It’s a phenomenal place to call home during your
    time at the Institute, and we can’t wait to show you why.</p>

<h1>A Taste of Simmons</h1>
<p><i>Written with love by Simmons residents:</i></p>
<p>
Stepping through the front entrance, you admire the distinguished architecture and striking design of Simmons Hall. Based on a video tour and what you can find online, Simmons is already an incredible dorm, with thousands of windows, several terraces, a two-story movie theater, a giant ball pit, and dozens of lounges scattered throughout the building.  However, Simmons is so much more than its facilities. It is home to an extraordinary group of undergraduates constantly doing exciting things. A dedicated house team takes care of us like no other, and we have an excellent government system, designed for openness and awesomeness.
</p>
<p>
Moseying down the hallway, you witness the vibrant life in Simmons. Pokemon drawings, physics equations, and maps from Game of Thrones adorn the curvy chalk-able walls. Laughter emanates from a group playing board games in one lounge and a massive 18.02 pset party fills another. You stop by our Housemaster's apartment to grab one of John's oh-so-delicious smoothies, and follow some enthusiastic freshmen to see their latest projects in our EE lab and workshop. Checking out a movie from front desk for later, you build a new tower out of the blocks in our mailbox lounge, and finally settle down in our dining hall to chat with some friendly Sims about life in the Sponge.
</p>
<p>
In an hour, everyone gets up to go to the house meeting, and your curiosity beckons you to follow. You grab some dessert, meet some new friends, and end up getting involved in Simmons activities. Our bi-weekly house meetings are open to every resident, and any resident can submit a proposal. Your imagination is the only limit – we've organized apple farm trips, boat cruises, Red Sox games, and Valentine's Day dinners. We've bought telescopes, servers, hammocks, speakers, and TVs. We've fostered residents' interests in fitness, cooking, gardening, and circuitry, and we've even considered playgrounds, ziplines, and teleporters (not all proposal pass). Doing cool things has never been easier than at Simmons.
</p>
<p>
On the MIT campus, all dorms are excellent, but Simmons is particularly open, diverse, and friendly. It's more than a place to live. Remember one thing, if nothing else: know that we call Simmons our home, and we welcome you to join us. We can't wait to see you in the fall!
