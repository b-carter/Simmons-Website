<h4>Dr. Hayden and Bianca Marcollo - Winter 2003 to Summer 2004</h4>
<p>
Hayden and Bianca Marcollo took residence in Simmons Hall in January 2003 and were our first Visiting Scholars. As the inaugural Scholars, they did much to craft the structure of the current program. Upon arrival from Australia, they met with and leaned the needs of the MIT undergraduate community. They fully integrated into all social events. During Friday Visiting Scholar nights, they introduced the students to the products of the Australian film industry in a series of events that became increasingly well attended, thus providing the program with its momentum. Their consistency in putting on events on Friday evenings helped make the program become a routine event. They became amongst the most visible members the Simmons Hall community.
</p>
<p>
Hayden received his Ph.D. in Offshore Engineering at Monash University, Australia. His stay at MIT was hosted by Professor Kim Vandiver in the Department of Ocean Engineering. Hayden's work is funded by the oil industry to improve the survivability of oil pipelines.  Bianca has the interesting profession of Midwife. While lacking a license to practice her craft in the US, she helped in Simmons with programs involving women’s health and has collaborated with the relevant groups on campus on such programs.  A central theme of the Marcollo's tenure in the program was to arrange trips to get students off campus, and into the local community and into other areas of New England.

His area of research expertise is mathematical physics and he is the lead author of the recent book entitled ``Singularity Theory and Gravitational Lensing.'' Arlie was a Martin Luther King, Jr. Visiting Professor in MIT's Department of Physics, where he is taught an introduction to relativity for undergraduates and conducted research on gravitational lensing.

He has written several articles on Simmons Hall, including an architectural review in the magazineDomus. In the spring of 2004 he co-coordinated an event with Jeffery Roberts, MIT class of 2002, dealing with the interplay between the evolution of the Simmons community and the evolution of the architectural design of the building. As part of his residency, Carlo would like to work with the resident students and faculty to describe the "lived-in" Simmons Hall.  Dr. Ratti has also collaborated with fellow Schollar, Tenzin Priyadarshi, to help design housing for people displaced by the 2005 tsunami in southeast Asia.

<h4>Professor Patrícia Carvalho - 2009 Academic Year</h4>
<p>
Professor Carvalho came to us as an Assistant Professor (tenured) in the Department of Materials Engineering, Instituto Superior Técnico, Technical University of Lisbon. Patricia obtained her PhD in Applied Physics at the University of Groningen, The Netherlands, where she lived from 1997 to 2001 and made dear friends from all over the world. She is a trained electron microscopist and her interests have been centered on materials characterization at the atomic and nano scales. Contact and collaboration with researchers from the biology and biotechnology fields led her to perceive that the techniques involved in materials characterization can also be used to investigate cells and biological tissues. Furthermore, the approaches used in materials science lead to new (and quantitative) insights into biological observations. In pursuit of her new scientific interests, she spent her sabbatical leave at MIT as a visiting scholar at the MIT Department of Materials Science and Engineering, working with Dean Subra Suresh on cell and molecular mechanics of human diseases, with a focus on malaria.
